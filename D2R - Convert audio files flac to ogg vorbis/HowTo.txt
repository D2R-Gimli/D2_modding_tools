Simple tutorial to convert flac to ogg in D2R.

Advantages: you save space & memory. Useful when you extracted the whole casc (40GB) for modding.

    Get yourself ffmpeg [1]
    In the Batch converter you first need to add a new profile (via app wizard \ create enc audio preset \ vorbis )
    for starters use the \Data\hd\global\music\introedit_hd.flac
    make sure output path is ".\" (source dir)
    convert with "-vn -c:a libvorbis".
    if successful delete the flac and start D2R with -direct -txt (you shouldn't hear any intro music)
    rename the .ogg extensions to .flac [2]
    profit!

Tools

[1] highly recommend "FFmpeg Batch AV Converter" from https://ffmpeg-batch.sourceforge.io/ very convenient and user friendly.
[2] use AntRenamer for batch processing https://www.fosshub.com/Ant-Renamer.html
